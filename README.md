## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The dataset is preprocessed, and a neural network model is trained to predict the species based on input features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
